Introduction:
=============

...

if you need premium support (and you will likely
do so in a commercial and productive environment)
currently it is better to use commercial products
like Elipcal's Claro, Softcolors Color or OneVisions
Amendo. This might change though, depending on how
much support the project gets.

Still, some of the software out there is quite buggy,
and so its quite legitimate to ask: Why pay for
bananaware, if you can have similar functions for free?

Rumors are that curent image enhancement technology
is not better than ImageMagick, a free tool. Unluckily
ImageMagick does not come with a ready-to-use interface,
contrary, using it can be quite delicate. There are 
even very sophisticated scripts, but using them is hard,
modifying them can be harder.

The tool aims for the Newspaper Market, where it is
not crucial to have 100 percent superb images, and
where cost is a major problem.
Therefore collaborating on such issues like color
management in an open manner can be beneficial for 
the whole branch.

*No more dongles, licences and price-discussions.
*Strange Behaviour can be identified by your local hacker.
*Latest technology library updates will result in speed.
(we do not fear breaking something, if so, we can fix and
release it on a daily basis).
*Forum to talk about common problems, place for experts
to discuss and exchange.
*Technology is crossplattform as possible, allows it
to be run on mobile phones. (at least some controller?)

As an open source project, we can use the all the power of the
open source world:

-OpenCV
-Lensfun
-Exiv 2
-Little CMS 2
-Magick++
-Qt
-PoDoFo
-Boost



Features:
=========

openPablo supports the following fileformats (thanks to Magick++):
  -JPG
  -JPG2000
  -TIFF
  -PNG
  -PSD
  -PDF
  -RAW (via dcraw++)

openPablo can handle the following metadata (thanks to Exiv2):
  -EXIF
  -IPTC
  -XMP
  -PSD Section

Tickets can be written either in JSON or in XML format. Any
tool that can edit these fileformats can be used to create
or modify tickets. The ticket API itself is open and documented.



Future:
=======

-Plugin System
We will try to implement a plugin-system, so you can develop 
commercial plugins without being forced to give away your code.
-GPU
-UI
-web2.0/crowd
-scene and object recognition
-create your own local server, or cloud-service
-test system/test set images
-JDF



The other side of the coin:
===========================

Though we will take some care not to include patented algorithms,
we cannot take any guarantees that by using this software, you are
making use of third-party patents.
If you see anything that infringes any patent or copyright, please
tell us, we will remove the offending parts immediately and will
try to find another workaround.
