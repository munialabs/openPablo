How To build darktable.app from source in 6 easy steps ;): INTEL ONLY will try universal build later ;)

Installing:


1) install XCode DeveloperPackage from Apple
   install macports from macports.org make shure you have the latest version ( sudo port -v selfupdate )
	
	!!! default install is /opt/local/ change this below if you have different macport dir !!!


2) (Optional) add +quartz +atsui +no_x11 -x11 to /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf
   (There have been some problems with DT when using GTK Quartz; X11 seems to work better, at least on my machine)
   set "buildmakejobs" to more than 1 in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf to use multiple threads 

3) run:
   sudo port -d sync
   sudo port install gtk2 libxml2 gphoto2 lensfun cairo pango librsvg gdk-pixbuf2 sqlite3 exiv2 curl libpng openjpeg tiff openexr lcms2 flickcurl libgnome-keyring gtk-engines2

	take a walk ! !

4) compile dt from git:

	git clone git://darktable.git.sf.net/gitroot/darktable/darktable
	cd darktable
	build.sh `pwd`/release Debug
	(Optional -- you don't need to enable debug)
	cd build
	make install

5) to make a disk image, run ./packaging/macosx/make-app-bundle -- this will create DarkTable.dmg in the release directory, which contains a standalone application.
