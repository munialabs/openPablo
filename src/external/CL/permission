Hi Ulrich,

Thank you for checking with us - I can confirm that the header files you li=
st are indeed under a free to use license and you may integrate them to you=
r project.

Your application sounds intriguing.  The OpenCL working group is looking to=
 outreach to selected developers on a private email feedback list.   I thin=
k the group would be interested in your input feedback on OpenCL functional=
ity and the OpenCL ICD mechanism that is under construction.

Would you be interested in providing feedback to the OpenCL group directly?=
  If so I can help in setting up the logistics to make that possible.

Best regards,

Neil

Subject: Permission to use OpenCL header files in open source project

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am seeking your advice and kind permission to use and distribute your Ope=
nCL=20
header files with an open source project called "Darktable".

Darktable is a photography workflow solution for Linux with a virtual=20
lighttable and darkroom. Its main focus and strength is in conversion and=20
development of photographic RAW-files. Details can be found at=20
http://darktable.sourceforge.net. Darktable is distributed in source code a=
nd=20
binary form under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE (GPL) Version 3=20
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

Darktable already supports OpenCL functionality in various parts. As a=20
consequence it is running with blazing speed at many typical processing ste=
ps=20
making it the best open-source raw converter available. It could be a perfe=
ct=20
advocate for the benefits of GPU computing as provided by OpenCL and help=20
propagate the idea.

Darktable's current limitation lies in the fact that a working OpenCL=20
development kit is required at compile time. The resulting binary will only=
=20
run on systems which have a working OpenCL run-time environment. As Linux=20
software distributions can not rely on this, they will have to ship darktab=
le=20
binaries with OpenCL deactivated, thus preventing wide spread use of OpenCL=
.

My goal is to modify Darktable in a way, that it is able to detect the=20
presence of OpenCL at run-time. I will use wrapper functions and dynamic=20
loading to accomplish this. At startup Darktable would search for an existi=
ng=20
OpenCL library and bind it if present. This way I would take advantage of t=
he=20
fact that many system already have a working OpenCL runtime library provide=
d=20
by a proprietary graphics card driver. That is the case e.g. for NVIDIA.

In order to do so, I need to include OpenCL specifications in form of  head=
er=20
files into Darktable's source code, namely the following files from your=20
OpenCL API registry (http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl):

	opencl.h
	cl_platform.h
	cl.h
	cl_ext.h
	cl_d3d10.h
	cl_gl.h
	cl_gl_ext.h
	cl.hpp

All with Version 1.0 or Version 1.1. depending on final implementation.

I understand the licensing terms in the preambles of your header files in t=
he=20
way that Khronos Group grants all third parties the right to use, copy,=20
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the=20
material as long as the copyright notice and permission notice in the pream=
ble=20
is included.

I would be indebted if you could confirm to me that my understanding in rig=
ht=20
and that I am allowed to include the above mentioned files into Darktables=
=20
source tree, which is distributed under GPL.

With best regards,

Ulrich Pegelow
